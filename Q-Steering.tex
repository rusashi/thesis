\chapter{Non-stationary policy evaluation without knowledge of a 'Switching state'}

\section{Introduction}

Describe the need to have an algorithm that can operate under conditions of not having a well-defined 'switching states'. Make a connection with previous chapter.

\section{Q-Steering.}

Introduce Q-Steering algorithm. Describe how it can operate without knowledge of 'switching state'.

\section{Q-Steering Empirical Results.}

Show the results of the benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Steering is in fact able to deliver its promises.
