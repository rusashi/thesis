\chapter{Simultaneous Learning of a Multiple Number of Policies.}

Intoductory text.

\section{Stationary Policy.}

Describe a mechanic of fixing one policy as active.

\subsection{Empirical results.}

Show the results of a simultaneous evaluation of more then one policy.

\subsection{Limitations.}

Describe how using only one policy as active may result in insufficient information about an environment state transition dynamics, which in turn may result in incorrect value functions.

\section{Non-stationary Policy.}

Describe how switching active policy helps to alleviate the shortcomings of using stationary policy.

\subsection{Switching states.}

Describe the need to have a state in which the decision about which base policy to use as active.

\subsection{W-Steering}

Descirbe algorithms details.

\subsection{W-Steering Empirical Results}

Show that W-Steering can deliver results in some of the cases but also has shortcomings in other cases.

\subsection{W-Steering Shortcomings.}

Speculate on the reasons why W-Steering may not deliver proper results. Describe the idea of switching states and how having of not having knowledge about them affects
